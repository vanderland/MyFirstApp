Django Todo App in Docker
=========================

This is an example project for a 
[blog post on the PyCharm blog](http://blog.jetbrains.com/pycharm/2017/08/using-docker-compose-on-windows-in-pycharm).
Please read more about it there.

To run the project, set up a Django compatible database (I use PostgreSQL but you're welcome to use something else)
and configure it in `djangodocker/settings.py`. 

To see the Docker version of this code, see the `dockerized` branch of this repo.
